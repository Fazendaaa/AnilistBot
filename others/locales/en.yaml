  *Episodes*\n\
  When new currently airing anime episodes are released, you will be notified about it.\n\n\
  *News*\n\
  When news about your animes is released — airing or not —, you will be notified about. This only works for news in English.\n\n\
  *Specific Cases*\n\
  If you would like to enable or disable notification to given animes/mangas, you can do that directly through the media in your lists.\n\n\
  Would you really like to disable *ALL* of the __episodes__ and __news__ notifications?"

timeOptions:
  "⏰ *TIME*\n\n\
  Change here the time for your notifications.\n\n\
  You can do that by setting the time by yourself — just remember my clock is the UTC clock — or send me your location in the user options so that way I can send you the notifications in your local time."

  *Anime Time Calculator*\n\n\
  Just a calculator of how much time you have passed watching anime.\n\n\
  *User Language*\n\n\
  By default I work with your Telegram language, if not provided my default language is English. If you want to change that, go to _User_ tab and change this.\n\n\
  *User Location*\n\n\
  _\"WHY ASKY MY LOCATION???\"_ — You\n\n\
  I won't follow you or anything, is simple: right now I'm running in a server, if you want to change your time for notifications and choose to be notified 13h, it will be 13h in the server time — that uses the UTC standard.\n\
  If you want to be notified in 13h in your country, I need to know what country is first.\n\
  Or you can also calculate your time in UTC hours; just a little reminder, of your country — like of my own creator — that has daylight saving, you need to consider that also.\n\n\
  *Watchlist/Readlist*\n\n\

  If you want to disable or enable notifications to specific animes, open it watchlist and then click more info.\n\
  Or event if want set a time of the day for receiving all notifications, click in _Time_ in _User_ tab."
